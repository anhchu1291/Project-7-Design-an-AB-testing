# Project-7-Design-an-AB-testing
Make design decisions for an A/B test, including which metrics to measure and how long the test should be run. Analyze the results of an A/B test that was run by Udacity and recommend whether or not to launch the change.

##Why this Project?

This project will require you to both make design decisions about how to run an A/B Test and analyze the results. Both are important skills for drawing conclusions based on online experiments.

##Project overview

In this project, you will consider an actual experiment that was run by Udacity. The specific numbers have been changed, but the patterns have not. You will flesh the experiment idea out into a fully defined design, analyze the results, and propose a high-level follow-on experiment. The project instructions contain more details: https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aCquhIqsUApgsxQ8-SQBAigFDcfWVVohLEXcV6jWbdI/pub?embedded=True 

##Project format

The project will have both qualitative and quantitative components. You should verify your answers to the quantitative components using the quizzes in this lesson, then combine both qualitative and quantitative answers into an overarching report using this template. (If you would like to create your report using Google Docs, you can copy this template using "File > Make a copy" if you are signed into Google Drive.) We recommend not adding your quantitative answers to your report until you have correctly passed all the quizzes.

##What will I learn?

After completing this project, you will be able to:

Select metrics to evaluate a proposed change
Characterize and validate those metrics
Plan an appropriate duration for your experiment based on the number of samples needed and the expected risk
Sanity check the results to make sure everything went smoothly
Draw a conclusion based on the results
Recommend whether or not to launch the change
